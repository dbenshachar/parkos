# Vulnerability Management Plan

## Automated Controls
- PR-time dependency review (`security-dependency-review.yml`).
- PR/push secret scanning (`security-secrets.yml`).
- CodeQL static analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust (`security-codeql.yml`).

## Manual and Scheduled Controls
- Quarterly external vulnerability scans of production endpoints.
- Quarterly authenticated internal scan of application runtime.
- Annual penetration test covering payment flow, auth, and API abuse.

## Severity and SLA
- Critical: fix or mitigate within 72 hours.
- High: fix within 14 days.
- Medium: fix within 45 days.
- Low: fix in normal backlog cycle.

## Reporting
- Keep vulnerability register with: severity, affected component, owner, status, and closure evidence.
- Include open high/critical findings in monthly security review.
